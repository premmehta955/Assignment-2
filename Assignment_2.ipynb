    "Q2. Refer the below variable: x='a' here, is x a character type or string type variable? Support your answer with an explanation. Answer: If \"x\" is defined as a single character using single quotes('x'), it would be considered a character type variable. In Python, individual characters are treated as strings of length one. So, even it is a single character, it is still considered a string. Program input: x='a' print(type(x)) #Program Output: <class 'str'>(string type)\n",
